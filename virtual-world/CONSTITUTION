Building a Nomad Nation

= Definition =
==Traditional definition ==
* A relatively large group of people organized under a single, usually independent government;
* A people who share common customs, origins, history, and frequently language; a nationality

== Our definition ==
* A relatively large group of people organized under a single, independent government sharing common values. 

== Core Values ==

We are uncovering better ways of living by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

* freedom  over anything
* technology over bureaucratie
* darwinism of small communities over regulation and control of entire societies
* decentralization over centralization

=== Market System ===
In order to establish charge value the nation uses an advanced market bidding system when establishing annual budget. 
The mechanic is simple: 

- As a citizen, you have two choices to pay your mandatory charges: 
	A. Pay cash
	B. Contribute time to one or more communities

Time is valued based on what people are willing to spend to get this service. 
We build a pool of resource of many given kind: 
	- Education Services
	- Healthcare Services
	- Security Services
	- Social Services
	- Industrial Services
	- Government Services
		- Constitution & Laws
		- International Treaties
		- Community Control
	- Economical Services
	- Other Services

=== For example: === 
Let's assume that we have 500 citizens. 
They have to first agree on a annual charge amount. Let's say: 2000$ each. This establish the national budget to 1,000,000$. Note that ALL citizens, including
children and old people share this charge. Money charges are taken from a Paypal account each month (166.67$ per month)

Each 2000$ can be split into financing communities in any of the previously listed categories, based on what the citizen believe is important
to him/her. Each community has a value proposition to the citizen, competing for the citizen money.

Each citizen must put 10% in government communities and 20% in social communities. The rest is up to them. It means that they spent 600$ in predefined
categories and 1400$ in the ones they think might be important. 

If you can't pay, you may still pay your charge by providing time to other citizens. 

Some examples: 
- A student might pay its charge by attending education courses and contributing to other communities. How exactly is an education hour is worth is not
known yet... 
	JG -> An idea might be that they postpone their charge payment until they can work... not sure...
	
- A mother contributes by taking care of her child. She's providing services to another citizen (her baby)
- One could register its renovation skills, which would be made hired by other citizens who need them. (market @ work here)

== Nation Goals ==

- Provide to each member freedom, security, education and economic emancipation. 
- Establish a system where social charges are equally split between all individuals. 
- Establish a system where individual success and society contribution are encouraged. 
- Establish a self organising government rules by market rules, based on people needs.
- Give the power to the people by letting them vote with their contribution money.  
- Encourage the creation of value
